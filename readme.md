# Cham
Quick boilerplate for setting up a basic Coffeescript driven app, with Stylus and Jade for the frontend. 

*Note: "Cham" is also a Malaysian/Singaporean drink that mixes coffee, hot chocolate, tea, sugar, milk and a bunch of other stuff. It's awesome. :3*

## How to use
* Clone this repo
* Copy all files to your new project
* Check out the docs for each file at the `/docs` folder
* Start hacking!

## The idea behind
I love Coffeescript. No doubt to that. So everytime I start a new project I find myself doing all the same steps over and over, creating folders, copying files, installing modules, setting up Cakefile tasks and all those trivial tasks. 

So I thought, why not create a template that I can use over? 

And then I thought, why not share it with everyone? Why not explain the rationale behind these structures as so to benefit others as well?

**Cham** is not meant to be a definitive guide to the universe of Express or Node.JS. It is a combination of ideas, regarding my personal approach of developing with Express, Coffeescript,  Jade and Stylus. 

## Cham is for...
* CoffeeScript, Jade and Stylus enthusiasts
* Developers that wanted a quick base to start working with
* Node.js beginners that want to learn more about Node.js with a more approachable example

## Last words
Fellow developers, please do share with me what are your thoughts, I would love to hear from you and see how we can do better!
